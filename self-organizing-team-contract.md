## Definition of Ready
To be considered Ready, work must be:

- Prioritized
- Defined and groomed
- Have Acceptance Criteria that is understood and verifiable
- Spikes are timeboxed
- Unblocked, unless otherwise agreed by the team

Blocked tickets will be denoted by the ticket ID in square brackets at the beginning of its summary, which should be removed when unblocked.  In addition the team will use linking to signal the blocks with other tickets.
We will use fluctuations in cycle time to help signal whether we need to improve the Definition of Ready and have better conversations about the work.  We will review at Retrospectives.

## Definition of Done
Work is considered Done when the following has been completed:

- Code review, trying to pull in other teams where desirable
- Unit tests for new code
- Existing tests pass
- Meets the Acceptance Criteria
- SOX approval
- Test plan
- Has been tested
- Product Owner approves work where applicable
- Has been merged to its parent branch
- Clear and complete release instructions
- Ticket has been closed/done

## Communication
The team will communicate through several media.

In person: Direct communication is preferred
E-mail: Email List <email@domain.com> mailing list addresses the entire team
Slack:  #channel
Outlook: All team members will open permissions on their calendars so that others can see the time, subject, and location of their appointments
Communication should be direct, honest, and respectful.
Stand ups: Google Hangout posted in Slack channel
Pair programming: Screen Hero supplemented with video where agreed upon
Basic communication: Slack
Urgent communication: Slack DM, Agile Coach
Don't rely on JIRA notifications or e-mail for time-sensitive matters.
Be cognizant of good distributed meeting etiquette and protocols.

## Decision Leader
The decision leader for technical issues is the Tech Lead. The decision leader for process issues is the Agile Coach. The decision leader for product issues is the Product Owner.
Any leader may delegate their decision authority where appropriate, such as when a technical member of the team has deeper experience in the decision area than the official decision leader.

## Attendance
Planned absences of one week or more should be communicated to the team at least one week in advance. All absences should be communicated to the team as soon as known.
Absences should be communicated to the team via e-mail or Slack. Planned absences should also be entered in Outlook as Out Of Office time. Outlook entries for absences should not invite other team members.
Coverage should be arranged for all planned absences, particularly for specialized roles.

Work in progress should be handed off in a manner that keeps it flowing.

# Per Team Choice

## Decision Rules
Example rule system (not mandatory):
The team will make decisions based on the following order of precedence:
1. Consensus (see below for consensus rules)
2. Decision leader decides after discussion
3. Delegation

## Consensus Rules
Example rule system (not mandatory):

```
Group consensus will happen through finger vote on the following scale:
1. Total agreement
2. Minor reservations
3. I disapprove!

All team members must vote 1 or 2 to achieve consensus. The team will hear the reservations of any voting 2 before ratifying the decision.
```

## How We Work
Some things to consider, some may be mutually exclusive:

- TDD
- Test coverage goals
- Remote work
- x % time
- Pair programming
- Mobbing
- Solo programming
