meet·ing
/ˈmēdiNG/

_noun._

1. synchronous time spent in discussion for a purpose
2. time you work away from your desk that is loudly distracting and
   vaguely stressful because people are arguing

## check in

- that everyone has done the prep
- on how much time in the meeting is remaining, on a regular basis
- that everyone is clear on what the goal of the meeting is
  - do we need to make a decision on something?
  - do we need to summarize a problem so we can discuss solutions?
- that the direction of the discussion is serving the goal of the meeting
  - if not, ask to put it in the parking lot
- that everyone has expressed their opinion
  - if someone is "lurking": specifically interrupt other conversations
    and ask them what they think
- about what people meant when they described things, ie. redescribe it in
  your own words, without trying to argue its merits
- that everyone call follow the terms of the discussion
  - put definitions up on the board
- that discussions with <= 25% of attendees don't go on more than a minute
  or two: maybe that subgroup needed to have a meeting before this one, or
  have a follow-up that could be put in the parking lot
- that there is general agreement about a direction or definition using
  a raise of hands, or by tracking people reiterating things on the board
