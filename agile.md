# agile

## [the agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

### **individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

### **working software** over comprehensive documentation

### **customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

### **responding to change** over following a plan

## context of agile manifesto

- development was "waterfall" style, with large up front design documents
- development was for clients in a consulting context

## scrum

### [implementation details](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/scrum-guide)

- a _framework_ for following the goals of the agile manifesto
- software is build in discrete units called "stories"
- product owner creates and keeps updated a prioritized backlog of
  stories
- stories are apportioned over "sprints"
- sprints are meant to be inviolate: you should not be adding or removing
  from the sprint
- stand up checks in on the progress of the sprint
- sprints end with retrospectives

### [how does it obey the agile manifesto?](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles)

- scrum is team oriented, and forces many "rituals" to get team members to
  communicate
- scrum requires finished software at regular intervals
- the product owner communicates with stakeholders constantly
- setting regular "check in" intervals helps a team see and respond to
  change

# lean

## [principles](https://www.infoq.com/resource/articles/poppendieck-implementing-lean/en/resources/poppendieck_ch02.pdf)
- eliminate waste
- build quality in
- create knowledge
- defer commitment (decide as late as possible)
- deliver fast
- respect people
- optimize the whole

### [waste](https://dzone.com/articles/seven-wastes-software)

Taiichi Ohno of the Toyota Production System. Translated from TPS context
to software:

- partially done work
- extra features
- relearning
- handoffs
- delays
- task switching
- defects

### kanban

Check out a [sample kanban
board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)#/media/File:Sample_Kanban_Board.png)
to help you see the emphasis on visualizing workflow.

- visual the workflow
- limit work in progress
- flow management
- making policies explicit
- using feedback loops
- collaborative or experimental evolution

Overall about trying to "pull" work, not wait for "pushes" of work
requests. Backlog prioritization and grooming is done "lean": you defer
commitment to work until the last possible responsible moment.

[Criticism of
kanban.](https://scrumcrazy.wordpress.com/2013/02/04/kanban-vs-scrum-kanban-is-not-for-software-development-but-scrum-is/)
The TL;DR is "kanban" by itself is not a whole development framework, and
would instead be applied to other frameworks.
