# scrummaster guidelines

## standup

### top level goals :watch: :chart_with_downwards_trend: & :ship: :heavy_check_mark:

1. standup should be **BRIEF**. eg. capped at 15 minutes for an 11 person
   team (or roughly 1 minute per team count plus some margin)
2. standup should keep us **FOCUSED** on delivery. ie. moving stories
   through our "pipeline" to launched

if the talking isn't serving those goals your job is to refocus your team:
put it in the parking lot! :rotating_light:

### what standup is NOT

- a time to discuss what decision to make about an issue
  - violates rule 1: does not keep standup BRIEF
  - solution: put it in the parking lot!
- a time to get progress reports from individuals
  - violates rule 2: does not keep standup FOCUSED
  - why: we don't need to know _what_ a dev is doing, we need to know
    whether work is moving to launched. until work has gotten blocked or
    slowed, why drill down?

### what standup is

- **a time the whole team is being kept from writing code**
- a time to see what's moved on the board and what hasn't
  - if it hasn't moved in a day or two: why not? does it need to be
    reassigned? does the dev need help? is it really blocked and not
    marked that way yet?
- a time to check in with dependencies
  - you have a code review out? who needs to approve it? do they know and
    will they have time?
  - your story is sequenced on another story: is it blocked yet?
- a time to reshuffle assignment because someone is trying to do too many
  stories at once

### parking lot :car:

parking lot is where we "park" issues we need to make a decision on or
form an action item from. at the end of standup you must ensure everyone
that needs to help clear the lot stays! every parked item should be
decided on or _assigned to a specific person to do_.

### fist of five :hand:

several times during a sprint you should ask for a vote of confidence in
delivering the sprint on time.

a simple "fist of five" is adequate: 1 is no confidence in delivering,
5 is total confidence. for a team that assigns all its work beforehand
have folks base their confidence on their individual workload. for a team
that doesn't forward-assign, assign confidence in the overall team
workload.

you need to ask this **when it is still actionable**. say in the below
calendar our sprint ran from the 2nd to the 16th. i'd check in on the 4th,
and the 9th. the 4th gives you a baseline, the 9th gives you 4 days to try
to correct whatever you discovered you didn't know.
